-- Q11.3 Recall myFoldl from lesson 9.
-- myFoldl f init [] = init
-- myFoldl f init (x:xs) = myFoldl f newInit xs
-- where newInit = f init x
-- What’s the type signature of this function?
-- Note: foldl has a different type signature.

myFoldl :: (b -> a -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
myFoldl f init [] = init
myFoldl f init (x:xs) = myFoldl f newInit xs
    where newInit = f init x
