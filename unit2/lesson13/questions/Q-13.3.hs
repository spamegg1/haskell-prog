-- Write the following function that works just like succ on Bounded
-- types but can be called an unlimited number of times without error.
-- The function will work like inc in the preceding example but works on a
-- wider range of types, including types that arenâ€™t members of Num :
-- cycleSucc :: (Bounded a, Enum a, ? a) => a -> a
-- cycleSucc n = ?
-- Your definition will include functions/values from Bounded , Enum ,
-- and the mystery type class. Make a note of where each of these three
-- (or more) functions/values comes from.

-- Answer:

-- class Bounded a where
--     minBound :: a                                                 -- USE THIS
--     maxBound :: a                                                 -- USE THIS

-- class Enum a where
--     succ :: a -> a                                                -- USE THIS
--     pred :: a -> a
--     toEnum :: Int -> a
--     fromEnum :: a -> Int
--     enumFrom :: a -> [a]
--     enumFromThen :: a -> a -> [a]
--     enumFromTo :: a -> a -> [a]
--     enumFromThenTo :: a -> a -> a -> [a]

-- class Eq a where
--     (==) :: a -> a -> Bool                                        -- USE THIS
--     (/=) :: a -> a -> Bool


cycleSucc :: (Bounded a, Enum a, Eq a) => a -> a
cycleSucc n = if n == maxBound then minBound else succ n
