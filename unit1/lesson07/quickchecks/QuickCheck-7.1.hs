-- Write down something mundane you do daily as a recursive process.

-- When writing a lesson for this book,
-- I write the lesson and then then do the following:
-- 1 Get edits from the editor.
-- 2 Accept or reject those changes and make my own edits.
-- 3 Submit the lesson to the editor.
-- 4 If the editor is happy, Iâ€™m finished!
-- Otherwise, go back to step 1.
