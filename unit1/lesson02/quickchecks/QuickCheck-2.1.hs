-- Many languages use the ++ operator to increment a value;
-- for example, x++increments x.
-- Do you think Haskell has an operator or function that works this way?

-- Answer: NO.
-- The ++ operator used in languages such as C++ couldnâ€™t exist in Haskell because
-- it violates our mathematical rules for functions.
-- The most obvious rule is that each time you call ++ on a
-- variable, the result is different.
