-- Q2.1
-- You used Haskell’s if then else expression to write calcChange.
-- In Haskell, all if statements must include an else component.
-- Given our three rules for functions, why can’t you have
-- an if statement all by itself?

-- Answer: without else, it may not always return a value (violate 2nd rule).
