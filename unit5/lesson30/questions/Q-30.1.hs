-- Q30.1
-- To prove that Monad is strictly more powerful than Functor, write a
-- universal version of <$>, as in the preceding lesson’s exercise, called
-- allFmapM, that defines <$> for all members of the Monad type class. Because
-- it works for all instances of Monad, the only functions you can use are the
-- methods required by the Monad type class (and lambda functions). To get you
-- started, here’s your type signature:
allFmapM :: Monad m => (a -> b) -> m a -> m b
allFmapM f ma = ma >>= (return . f)

test = allFmapM (^2) (Just 2) -- Just 4
