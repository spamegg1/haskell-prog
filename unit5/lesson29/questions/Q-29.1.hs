-- Q29.1
-- To prove that Applicative is strictly more powerful than Functor, write a
-- universal version of fmap, called allFmap, that defines fmap for all members
-- of the Applicative type class. Because it works for all instances of
-- Applicative, the only functions you can use are the methods required by the
-- Applicative type class. To get you started, here’s your type signature:
allFmap :: Applicative f => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
-- When you’re finished, test this out on List and Maybe, which are both members
-- of Applicative:
-- GHCi> allFmap (+ 1) [1,2,3]
-- [2,3,4]
-- GHCi> allFmap (+ 1) (Just 5)
-- Just 6
-- GHCi> allFmap (+ 1) Nothing
-- Nothing

-- Answer:
allFmap fun contextVal = pure fun <*> contextVal
