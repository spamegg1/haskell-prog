-- Q29.3
-- Take the following example and use nondeterministic computing with Lists to
-- determine how much beer you need to purchase to assure there will be enough:
-- You bought beer last night but don’t remember whether it was a 6-pack or a
-- 12-pack.
-- You and your roommate each had two beers last night.
-- You’re having either two or three friends coming over tonight, depending on
-- who can come.
-- For a long night of gaming, you expect the average person to drink three to
-- four beers.

-- Answer:
startingBeer :: [Int]
startingBeer = [6,12]
remainingBeer :: [Int]
remainingBeer = (\count -> count - 4) <$> startingBeer
guests :: [Int]
guests = [2,3]
totalPeople :: [Int]
totalPeople = (+ 2) <$> guests
beersPerGuest :: [Int]
beersPerGuest = [3,4]
totalBeersNeeded :: [Int]
totalBeersNeeded = (pure (*)) <*> beersPerGuest <*> totalPeople
beersToPurchase :: [Int]
beersToPurchase = (pure (-)) <*> totalBeersNeeded <*> remainingBeer
